            <h2>Unicorns in Modern Times</h2>
            <h3>How are unicorns used and perceived today?</h3>
            <p>Unicorns today are not considered to be real creatures, but they are still a common sight.  They appear in shows, art, toys, and even have foods themed after them.  
                Unicorns are often used as sigh of uniqueness and individuality.  They are often associated with rainbows and sparkles.  Unicorns are also often considered to be
                girlish, with most marketing of unicorns being directed at younger girls.  Unicorns today are less about purity and healing and more about expressing oneself and
                positivity.  Unicorns, much like other mythical creatures, are also a way for people to expand their imaginations and experiment with the fantastical.

            <h2>Unicorns in Modern Media</h2>
            <h3>How are unicorns portrayed in modern media?</h3>
            <p>Unicorns are most often portrayed in media as majestic, magical creatures.  A lot of unicorns appear in media aimed at younger girls.  Barbie, a fashion doll and
                fictional character icon, has often been portrayed with unicorns.  The My Little Pony series, a media franchise aimed at girls also features unicorn characters.
                Furthermore, unicorns are also associated with princesses in general and will often appear as companions to princess characters in media.  Unicorns are not often
                the protagonists or main characters of their stories.  This could be because unicorns in the past have been seen as otherworldly, untouchable, and pure.  As a result,
                people may not feel like they can relate to them as much.

            <h3>Similarities and Differences Between Unicorns and Dragons</h3>

                of great power.  Body parts of both unicorns and dragons are considered to be valuable.  Additionally, both dragons and unicorns appear in fairytales.  Despite this,

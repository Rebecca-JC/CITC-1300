            <h2>What Are Dragons?</h2>
            <h3>Everyone has heard about them, but what are they?</h3>
            <p>Dragons are mythological creatures.  Their appearance has varied throughout cultures and history, but Western depictions of dragons usually portray them with wings
                and spiked tails.  Furthermore, dragons are generally evil or malicious creatures in Western fairytales.  Along with having the ability to fly, dragons are often given
                the ability to breathe fire.  However, despite the more common winged depictions of dragons in Western cultures, dragons have also been portrayed as looking more 
                like serpents.  In East Asian mythology, dragons are more benevolent creatures and are considered prestigious.  Both Japanese and Chinese dragons are often depicted 
                as wingless, despite being considered powers of the air.

            <h2>What Are Unicorns?</h2>
            <h3>They're a common decoration, but what actually are unicorns?</h3>
            <p>Unicorns are mythological creatures.  They are often depicted as horse-like animals with a single horn on their forehead.  However, unicorns have also sometimes
                resembled goats.  Unicorns appear in several cultures' myths and artworks, such as Mesopotamia, India, China, and Europe.  Unicorns are often thought to have some
                great power, usually related to healing or purifying.  In some unicorn stories, unicorns could only be touched or tamed by virgins.  Interestingly, there are several 
                accounts of unicorns and unicorn horns existing - it is now thought that real life animals such as the rhinoceros were believed to be unicorns.

            <h2>What are the Disney Fairies?</h2>
            <h3>Everyone knows Tinker Bell by name, but who exactly is she?</h3>
            <p>Tinker Bell initially showed up in Peter Pan, as a companion to the character Peter Pan.  She was not the focus of the movie and is even jealous of another character,
                Wendy Darling.  However, Tinker Bell rapidly became a mascot for Disney and in 2005 Disney launched Disney Fairies.  Disney Fairies not only expanded on Tinker Bell
                and the place fairies live in Never Land - Pixie Hollow - but also introduced a new cast of characters.  In Disney Fairies, the first laugh of a newborn is what
                creates the fairies.  The Disney Fairies are technically part of Never Land, but have grown in popularity to the point that many think of them as their own world
                and stories outside of Never Land.

            <h2>Popular Disney Fairies</h2>
            <h3>Who are some of the most popular Disney Fairies?</h3>
            <p>Tinker Bell is by far the most well-known Disney Fairy, with her signature blonde bun and green dress.  Her character in Disney Fairies is different from that of
                her character in the Peter Pan movie.  She is the protagonist and is shown to be more friendly and relatable.  She is a tinker fairy, which means she mends pots and
                kettles.  Iridessa (far left in the above image) is a light fairy who likes order.  She is friends with Tinker Bell.  Rosetta (middle in the above image, in the
                red dress) is a garden fairy who dislikes dirt, mud, and bugs.  She is another one of Tinker Bell's friends.  Fawn (middle right in the above image, in the orange 
                dress) is an animal fairy who loves animals and is friends with Tinker Bell.  Silvermist (second on the right in the above image, in the blue dress) is a water fairy
                with a sweet personality and is friends with Tinker Bell.  Vidia (far right in the above image) is a fast-flying fairy.  She and Tinker Bell have a more mixed
                relationship, but they are ultimately friends.
            </p>

            <h2>Disney Fairies in Real Life</h2>
            <h3>The Disney Fairies are a part of Disney parks, how can guests interact with them?</h3>
            <p>Out of the many characters a person can see walking around the Disney parks, the Disney Fairies are some of them.  Guests can visit Pixie Hollow and meet the
                Disney Fairies.  This includes characters such as Tinker Bell, Vidia, Rosetta, Silvermist, Iridessa, Periwinkle, Fawn, and Terrence.  Guests can talk to the fairies
                and take photos with them.  Guests can also get the fairies' autographs.  Additionally, Tinker Bell flies from Cinderella's Castle every night during the nightly 
                fireworks show.  While this isn't a direct interaction, it is still a magical experience that brings the Disney Fairies to life.

            <h2>Disney Fairies Outside the Parks</h2>
            <h3>How can the Disney Fairies be seen outside the parks?</h3>
            <p>The Disney Fairies can be found plenty of places outside of the Disney Parks.  Independent character companies may offer Tinker Bell as an option to hire for
                parties or events.  Furthermore, the Disney Fairies have a massive amount of media dedicated to them.  Several Disney Fairies movies have been made since they
                launched.  Additionally, Disney Fairies books and games have been created.  There are hundreds of Disney Fairies toys out there, from dolls to plushies to figures.
                Disney also sells Disney Fairies costumes, allowing people to dress up as their favorite fairies.  The Disney Fairies can be found on most household items, from
                bedding to lunchboxes to towels to storage containers.

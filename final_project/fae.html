            <h2>What are Fae?</h2>
            <h3>Fae are fairly well-known, but exactly are they?</h3>
            <p>Fae are mythical creatures, that appear in lots of folklore.  It is important to note that although fairies can be fae, not all fae are necessarily fairies.
                Fae often have supernatural powers of some kind and are known for their tricky and cunning nature.  The fae often exist in the fairy realm, but in some tales they
                overlap with the human world as well.  Interestingly, fae have an incredible weakness to iron.  What iron does to the fae can differ depending on the tale, but typically
                it permanently injures the fae.  Iron chains have also been used to restrain fae and block their abilities to use their powers.

            <h2>Rules of the Fae</h2>
            <h3>What are some common rules of the fae?</h3>
            <p>The rules of the fae - and dealing with fae - can differ, but there are a few common rules.  A major rule is to never accept a gift from the fae.  If a person
                accepts a gift from the fae, they will be in their debt.  Another major rule is to never give a fae your real name, as a person giving them their true name gives the
                fae control over them.  Fae consider "thank you" to be rude, so it is best to avoid thanking them.  Maintaining respect is important when interacting with the fae -
                lying, breaking promises, and bragging are all considered to be rude at best and dangerous at worst.  If a person is in the fairy realm, they cannot eat the food there
                as this can trap them there forever.  Fae are fickle creatures, so knowing and following the rules is important for personal safety and wellbeing.

            <h2>Fae in Modern Times</h2>
            <h3>How are fae used in present times?</h3>
            <p>In modern times, fae are often used in media and entertainment.  Fae appear in several fantasy games including Dungeons and Dragons, a fantasy tabletop role-playing 
                game.  Books and shows about or featuring fae also exist in many forms.  Dressing up as fae is a popular activity, with many people sharing their designs and 
                photos online.  Fae are also popular in fandom communities, where fans will invent alternate universes where one or more of the characters is a fae.  Fae have become 
                a source of fascination, with people sharing the rules of the fae and various mythical tales with each other.  In this way, the fae, like many mythical creatures, 
                allows people to experiment and explore the fantastical.

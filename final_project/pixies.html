            <h2>What are Pixies?</h2>
            <h3>Pixies is a common word for fairies, but what exactly are they?</h3>
            <p>Pixies are in southwestern England folklore.  They are tiny fairies or elflike spirits.  In traditional folklore, they wear green and dance to the sound of
                crickets and frogs in the moonlight.  They enjoy frightening young girls or leading travelers astray.  They are very mischievous fairies, and will rap on walls,
                blow out candles, and play in water.  They are often portrayed as residing in nature, mainly the woods.  Pixies are often what people think of when they hear the word
                fairy.
            </p>

            <h2>Pixies in Modern Times</h2>
            <h3>How are pixies used in present day?</h3>
            <p>As stated above, pixies are often what people think of when they hear the word fairy.  Oftentimes, most fairy decorations mimic the pixie in style.  Most fairies
                in modern shows would fall under the classification of pixie as well.  Tinker Bell is a famous example and it can even be heard in the name of her home - Pixie Hollow.
                Nowadays, pixies and fairies are considered to be the same thing, although technically pixies are only a kind of fairy.  Most fairy stories and costumes aimed at
                young girls often feature pixies, but they are marketed simply as fairy.  The image of the pixie has become the standard image for fairies, most often with a feminine
                design.  This is a major change from the original folklore of the pixie.

            <h2>Other Uses of the Word "Pixie"</h2>
            <h3>Does the word always refer to the mythical creatures?</h3>
            <p>The word pixie is fairly common, but it doesn't always have something to do directly with the creatures of folklore.  However, words have been inspired by pixie
                such as the word pixilated.  Pixilated literally means "led astray by pixies" and can mean crazy or confused.  A popular haircut, known as the pixie cut derives its
                name from the mythological pixies.  Pixie has also become a popular word on its own, used for movies and characters.  Most notably is the manic pixie dream girl, which is a stock 
                character type in fiction.  She is usually depicted as a young woman with eccentric personality quirks and serves as the romantic interest for a male protagonist in the 
                story.

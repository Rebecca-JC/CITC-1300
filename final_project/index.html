            <h2>What are Fairies?</h2>
            <h3>Everyone has heard of them, but what are they?</h3>
            <p>Fairies are mythical creatures and are quite common in folklore.  They usually have magic powers and live close to humans.  Fairies have many different shapes and forms
                and different abilities.  Fairies can live their own Fairyland or take up residence in human homes.  Fairies can be benevolent, evil, mischievous, or well-intentioned.
                Fairies are thought to live longer than humans, but they do not have souls and simply perish at death.  Some fairies are depicted with wings, but a creature does not have
                to have wings to be considered a fairy.

            <h2>What are the Different Kinds of Fairies?</h2>
            <h3>There are many types of fairies out there, but what are they exactly?</h3>
            <p>Fairies come in many shapes and sizes and have different abilities.  Furthermore, there are more modern depictions of fairies such as the Disney fairies, with characters
                like the iconic Tinker Bell.  A common sight around St. Patrick's Day is the leprechaun, short humanoids typically depicted as dressed in green.  Leprechauns are
                actually a kind of fairy and they are covered in more detail on the leprechauns page of this website.  The pixie is commonly what people think of when they envision
                a fairy - a small winged creature.  Tinker Bell is one example of a pixie.  The mysterious fae also encompasses fairies - although it is important to note that not
                all fae are fairies.  Fairies are merely part of the categories of creatures known as fae.  That being said, there is much debate over how much of the fae are fairies
                and how much difference there is between the two.  Other kinds of fairies can include brownies, sprites, nymphs, dryads, and elves.

            <h2>Fairies in Modern Times</h2>
            <h3>Fairies are mythical creatures, but what impact do they have in the real world?</h3>
            <p>Nowadays, fairies are a very common sight, possibly one of the most commonly recognized mythical creatures in the Western world.  From fairy costumes to fairy parties
                to fairy figurines, fairies are popular decorations and styles.  Fairies are also quite common in modern media, either as background characters or main characters.
                Some of the most well-known fairies are the Disney fairies, which are covered in the Disney fairies page of this website.  Although fairies often appear in fairytales,
                such as Sleeping Beauty, they also appear in classical literature, such as William Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream", which is still performed in modern times.  
                Furthermore, in more recent times new fairies have been invented, such as the Tooth Fairy, who supposedly exchanges the lost teeth of children for little gifts.  Often,
                this gift is some amount of money.  Overall, fairies are a way for humans to believe in the mythical and magical, while providing entertainment for all ages.

            <h2>What are Leprechauns?</h2>
            <h3>They're a common sight around St. Patrick's Day, but what exactly are they?</h3>
            <p>Leprechauns come from Irish folklore.  They are a kind of fairy, often portrayed as tiny old men with hats.  Sometimes leprechauns are known to make or mend shoes.  Leprechauns
                also often have a crock full of gold which they've hidden someplace.  If captured and threatened, a leprechaun might reveal his hiding place for his gold.  However, the captor has to keep their eyes
                on the leprechaun at all times, for the fairy can vanish the moment the captor is tricked into looking away.  Leprechauns are also known for their trickery and cunning
                nature.

            <h2>Leprechauns and St. Patrick's Day</h2>
            <h3>How are leprechauns related to the holiday?</h3>
            <p>Leprechauns originate from Irish folklore, so it follows that a holiday mainly about Irish culture would include them.  Leprechauns don't have much of a connection
                beyond that, but by now they are practically an expected part of St. Patrick's Day.  This is likely because leprechauns were growing in popularity in the western world
                around the same time that St. Patrick's Day celebrations were growing in popularity as well.  Furthermore, the legends of the leprechauns make for good stories to tell
                around the holiday.  Nowadays, people dress up as leprechauns for the holiday and decorate with leprechauns.  Interestingly, leprechauns have their own holiday on May 13th,
                but most people do not know about it, celebrating them on St. Patrick's Day instead.

            <h2>Leprechauns in the Modern World</h2>
            <h3>How are leprechauns used in present times?</h3>
            <p>Leprechauns are heavily associated with St. Patrick's Day, but this is not all they are associated with.  One notable example is the Lucky Charms cereal, with its
                signature mascot, Lucky the Leprechaun.  Leprechauns are also considered to be a sign of luck in general, with various symbols associated with leprechauns also associated
                as symbols of luck.  However, the most notable example is the Disney movie Darby O'Gill and the Little People.  This movie, released in 1959 covers the adventures of an
                elderly man named Darby O'Gill, who captures the leprechaun king, King Brian.  Darby demands three wishes of King Brian but the wishes he makes ends up playing out in
                unexpected ways.  This movie is what helped to bring leprechauns to popular attention in the western world and remains a classic example of leprechauns to this day.  Overall,
                in the western world, leprechauns are mainly used for entertainment and a representation of Irish culture.

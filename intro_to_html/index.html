    <h2>What is a Mermaid?</h2>
    <h3>Everyone has seen portrayls of mermaids, such as Disney's "The Little Mermaid", but what actually are mermaids?</h3>
    <p>A mermaid is a mythical marine creature.  Mermaids have the tail of a fish but the upper body of a human being.  Although there are male mermen, 
       mermaids in folklore and paintings were often portrayed as females.  In European folklore, mermaids had magical and prophetic powers.  Mermaids in
       European folklore also loved singing and dancing.  Despite living long lives, mermaids were considered mortal, but had no souls.  Mermaids in general have often been seen as 
       having a conflicting personality - a beautiful, seductive woman, yet a sea creature that lured sailors to their deaths.  However, legends about mermaids appear in several cultures
       across the world and have existed for thousands of years.  This has led to kinder interpretations of mermaids, such as mermaids representing good fortune.  For more information on the
       history of mermaids and various mermaid legends, visit <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/mermaid" target="_blank">Britannica</a> and

    <h2>Mermaids in Modern Times</h2>
    <h3>It is no longer believed that mermaids exist in the seas, so what purpose do they serve in present day?</h3>
    <p>Mermaids have captured the attention of humans for centuries.  However, in modern times, it is generally believed that mermaids do not exist.  Despite this, mermaids have
       remained popular in modern day art, media, toys, and costumes.  In this way, the mermaid serves the same role as other mythical creatures, such as fairies, elves, unicorns, and
       vampires.  They provide entertainment, interesting stories, fun designs, and let humans experiment with the fantastical.  Stories such as "The Little Mermaid" have interested
       people since its creation, popularized by the Disney movie versions of the fairytale.  Such movies allow people to experience and imagine worlds unlike their own, filled with 
       magic and discovery.  Most interesting of all, "mermaid businesses" have popped up in modern times, where people make a living by acting as mermaids.  They perform in
       underwater shows, which people can watch to see a "real life mermaid".  Netflix created a documentary series detailing the professional mermaid world, and how it works.  For
       more information on this documentary series, visit <a href="https://collider.com/merpeople-netflix-professional-mermaid/" target="_blank">Collider's article about the
